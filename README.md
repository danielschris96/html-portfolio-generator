## Description

We recently completed a project where we demonstrated our proficiency in Node.js by creating a program that generates an HTML site with information collected from the user through a command line interface.

We began by setting up the Node.js environment and installing the necessary packages, such as Inquirer.js, to prompt the user with questions. The questions we created asked for the user's name, location, a short bio, their LinkedIn username, and their GitHub username.

After the user answered all the questions, the program used the responses to dynamically generate an HTML file using Node.js's File System module. The HTML file displayed all the information collected from the user along other assets provided.

To make the program more user-friendly, we also added validation to ensure that the user input was in the correct format and that all required fields were filled out. In addition, we styled the HTML file to make it look more professional and polished.

Overall, this project allowed us to showcase our skills in Node.js and demonstrated our ability to create dynamic applications that can generate content based on user input. We also gained valuable experience working with command line interfaces and user input validation, which will be beneficial in our future projects.
